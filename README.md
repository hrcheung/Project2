Before we do CRUD, we need to create account, database, container and  onto Azure CosmosDB. 

from high level to low level, the structure of above concepts are as below:

                CosmosDB Account
                        ⬇️
                     Database
                        ⬇️
                     Container
                        ⬇️
                       Item
